#introduction to computer vision with python

This intro is going to stick to cv2 and python 2, even though there are many other computer vision tools out there.

## Before you get there

If you have trouble with this, we will do troubleshooting during the last third of the tutorial.  However, if you want to follow along during the middle third, get the packages in place.

Numpy and opencv are compiled packages, so either you will need to install binaries, or have a compiler ready to go. Mostly this will be difficult for the windows folks.

### Linux

* apt-get install python
* apt-get install python-numpy
* apt-get install python-opencv
(or your favorite package manager)

### OSX

TODO

### Windows

If you have a compiler
* install python
  * https://www.python.org/downloads/
* pip install numpy
* openCV
  * is opencv pip installable?


If you don't have a compiler
* install python
    * https://www.python.org/downloads/
* install prereqs
 * numpy: http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.9.2/
 * note: the link on scipy.org leads to an old version of numpy
* install openCV
  * http://opencv.org/
* install cv2 bindings for python
  * already comes with opencv?
